# Dotfiles

Built on Fedora but should be roughly portable with some extra work. Needs the
`lsb-release` command to function at the moment but then installs the other
necessary packages when `bin/install` is run.

Uses GNU `stow` to manage dotfiles, but this is not yet automated.

```sh
path/to/dotfiles $ stow -Rv --dotfiles -d ./dotfiles/ -t ~ <name> ...
# or more simply
path/to/dotfiles/dotfiles $ stow -Rv --dotfiles -t ~ *
```
